# AI Benchmarking & Analytics Architecture

## 1. Overview

The AI Benchmarking & Analytics system consists of two primary modules designed to enhance the RWP 4.0 platform's recruitment capabilities:

### AI Benchmarking Engine

This module provides recruiters with data-driven guidance by:
- Analyzing candidate profiles against industry benchmarks
- Identifying high-potential candidates based on historical placement success
- Providing AI-powered recommendations for candidate selection
- Offering real-time scoring during the recruitment process

### Hiring Analytics Dashboard & Insight Reporting

This module delivers actionable insights through:
- Comprehensive analytics dashboards for recruiters and clients
- Automated report generation with key performance indicators
- Trend analysis across recruitment cycles
- Predictive analytics for future hiring needs

Together, these modules form a powerful system that leverages AI to optimize the recruitment process, improve placement success rates, and provide valuable insights to both recruiters and clients.

The system architecture follows a modular design with clear separation between data ingestion, processing, storage, and presentation layers:

1. **Data Sources Layer**:
   - JobAdder API integration for candidate and placement data
   - Payload CMS for content management and configuration
   - Event Tracking system for user interactions and behavioral data

2. **Processing Layer**:
   - AI Enrichment module for enhancing candidate profiles with AI-derived insights
   - Benchmarking Engine for comparing candidates against industry standards
   - Analytics Generator for creating actionable insights and reports

3. **Storage Layer**:
   - Analytics Database for persistent storage of processed data
   - Redis Cache for high-performance data access and real-time analytics

4. **Output Layer**:
   - Recruiter Dashboard for internal team use
   - Client Dashboard for external stakeholder access
   - Report Generator for automated insight delivery
