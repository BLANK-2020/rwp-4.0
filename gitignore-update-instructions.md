# Instructions for Updating .gitignore

To ensure that your `ideas.md` file isn't included in version control and won't be visible when the platform is published, please update your `.gitignore` file with the following steps:

1. Open the `.gitignore` file in your project's root directory
2. Add the following line at the end of the file:

```
# Personal notes and ideas
ideas.md
```

3. Save the file

This will prevent Git from tracking the `ideas.md` file, ensuring it won't be included in any commits or pushed to your repository.

## Alternative Approach

If you prefer not to modify the `.gitignore` file, you can also:

1. Keep the file in a directory that's already ignored (like `/docs` if that's ignored)
2. Rename it to something that matches an existing pattern (e.g., if `*.local` is ignored, name it `ideas.local.md`)

## Checking If It's Working

After updating your `.gitignore`, you can verify it's working by running:

```bash
git status
```

The `ideas.md` file should not appear in the list of tracked or untracked files.
