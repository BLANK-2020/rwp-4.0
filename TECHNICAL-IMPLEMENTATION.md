## Code Organization

The codebase follows a modular structure with clear separation of concerns:

### Package Structure

Each package in the monorepo follows a similar structure:

```
package-name/
├── src/
│   ├── app/              # Next.js app directory
│   │   ├── (frontend)/   # Frontend routes
│   │   ├── (payload)/    # Payload CMS routes
│   │   ├── api/          # API routes
│   ├── collections/      # Payload CMS collections
│   ├── lib/              # Shared utilities
│   ├── plugins/          # Plugin integrations
│   └── tests/            # Test files
├── package.json          # Package configuration
├── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration
└── README.md             # Package documentation
```

### API Structure

API endpoints follow a consistent pattern:

```typescript
// src/app/api/resource/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  try {
    // Implementation
    return NextResponse.json({ data });
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: error.message }, { status: 500 });
  }
}

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  try {
    const body = await request.json();
    // Implementation
    return NextResponse.json({ data }, { status: 201 });
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: error.message }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

### Database Models

Database models are defined using Payload CMS collections:

```typescript
// src/collections/Jobs.ts
import { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types';

export const Jobs: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'jobs',
  admin: {
    useAsTitle: 'title',
  },
  access: {
    read: () => true,
  },
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'title',
      type: 'text',
      required: true,
    },
    // Other fields
  ],
};
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Multi-Tenancy

The platform supports multiple tenants (recruitment agencies) through the `rwp-tenants` package:

- Each tenant has its own configuration, branding, and data
- Tenant identification is done through subdomain or path prefix
- Database queries are automatically scoped to the current tenant
- Assets and media are stored in tenant-specific directories

### JobAdder Integration

The JobAdder integration in `rwp-jobadder` package handles:

1. **OAuth Authentication**:
   - OAuth 2.0 flow for secure API access
   - Token refresh and management
   - Secure storage of credentials

2. **Job Synchronization**:
   - Periodic polling of JobAdder API
   - Differential updates to minimize data transfer
   - Mapping JobAdder fields to internal schema

3. **Webhook Handling**:
   - Real-time updates from JobAdder
   - Event-based processing
   - Idempotent operations for reliability

### Event Tracking

The event tracking system in `rwp-events` package:

1. Captures user interactions:
   - Page views
   - Job views
   - Application starts/completions
   - Search queries

2. Processes events:
   - Enriches with context data
   - Validates and sanitizes
   - Stores in database

3. Publishes events:
   - To analytics system
   - To retargeting system
   - To external integrations

### AI Enrichment

The AI enrichment system in `rwp-ai-enrichment` package:

1. **CV Parsing**:
   - Extracts structured data from CVs
   - Identifies skills, experience, education
   - Normalizes data for consistency

2. **Candidate Scoring**:
   - Matches candidates to job requirements
   - Calculates fit scores
   - Provides explanations for scores

3. **Job Enhancement**:
   - Improves job descriptions
   - Suggests keywords for better visibility
   - A/B tests different descriptions

## Data Flow

### Job Application Flow

1. Candidate views job on `rwp-jobboard`
2. `rwp-events` tracks the job view
3. Candidate starts application
4. Application data is submitted to `rwp-core`
5. `rwp-core` forwards to `rwp-jobadder`
6. `rwp-jobadder` creates candidate in JobAdder
7. `rwp-ai-enrichment` processes the CV
8. Candidate receives confirmation
9. Recruiter is notified in JobAdder

### Analytics Flow

1. User interactions are tracked by `rwp-events`
2. Events are stored in database
3. `rwp-analytics` processes events
4. Aggregated data is stored
5. Dashboards display metrics
6. Reports are generated

## Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Tenant isolation
- API key management for integrations

### Data Protection

- PII (Personally Identifiable Information) handling
- GDPR compliance
- Data retention policies
- Encryption of sensitive data

### API Security

- Rate limiting
- CORS configuration
- Input validation
- Output sanitization

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Component tests with React Testing Library
- Utility function tests with Jest
- API handler tests with mocked requests

### Integration Testing

- API endpoint tests with database integration
- Cross-package functionality tests
- Webhook handling tests

### End-to-End Testing

- User flow tests
- JobAdder integration tests
- Analytics flow tests

## Performance Optimization

### Frontend

- Client-side navigation for subsequent pages
- Image optimization
- Code splitting
- Lazy loading

### Backend

- Batch processing for heavy operations
- Asynchronous processing for non-critical tasks

### Database

- Performance metrics
- Error tracking
- User experience monitoring

## Conclusion

The RWP 4.0 platform is designed with scalability, maintainability, and performance in mind. The modular architecture allows for independent development and deployment of components, while the shared core ensures consistency across the platform.
